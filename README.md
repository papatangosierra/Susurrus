# Untitled Timer App

Untitled Timer App is a multiplayer countdown timer. It's designed to be a simple, low-investment tool that capitalizes on some of the benefits of the the [body doubling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_doubling) effect to doing work.

Visiting the base Untitled Timer App site will immediately redirect you to a new `/timer/` URL. That URL corresponds to a single timer instance, and will persist as long as at least one person is currently viewing the timer.

To invite other users to a timer, simply give them the URL of the timer you're currently in.

Untitled Timer App requires no signup or login information. Each user gets a randomly generated name that lasts only as long as they are actively viewing the timer.

Only a timer's owner can start, reset, and edit the timer. A timer's owner is initially set to the first user to join the timer. If the owner leaves the timer while other users are still present, owner status will be given to one of the remaining users.

If you can see the start/reset button on the timer, you are its owner.

The timer's duration can be adjusted using either the arrows above and below the digits, or by dragging and rotating the dial.

If the owner edits the timer, those edits are immediately visible to other users of the timer. When the owner starts the timer, it immediately starts counting down for all users.

When a timer completes, a short melody plays.

The **Ping** button plays an audible ping sound for all users of the timer. Each user's ping has a different pitch, and when a ping is received, the pinging user's name briefly flashes to indicate its source.

A ping is meant to send a signal of continuing presence—an "I'm still doing this" message. Depending on the specific context in which the timer is being used, a ping could signal the completion of a unit of work—a sentence or paragraph of writing drafted, a surface dusted, a piece of mail sorted, whatever—or just a simple "hey!"

Owing to the nature of web browser audio, you will not be able to hear any pings until you send a ping yourself.
